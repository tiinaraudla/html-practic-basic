<h2><i>The teenager travelled through 52 countries over five continents</i></h2>
<p>A teenage pilot is set to become the youngest person to fly around the world solo in a small aircraft, after landing in Bulgaria, where his journey began five months ago.
    Mack Rutherford, a Belgian-British dual national aged 17, touched down at an airstrip west of Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia, to complete his trip and to claim two Guinness World Records.
    Once his achievement is certified, he will become the youngest person to fly around the world by himself, as well as the youngest person to circumnavigate the globe in a microlight plane.</p>
